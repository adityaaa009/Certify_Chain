# Certify_Chain
Blockchain based e-certificate generation, verification and storage platform.


This was our project for Smart India Hackathon 2023:- 
"Currently large no of training programs is organized, and certificates are provided. There is no mechanism to validate digital certificate.so create a system in which custom digital certificate generate. User can store certificate in digital locker system other organization will validate certificate. Use opensource software and blockchain technology. Expected Output: Blockchain Based Certificate generation and validation Certificate can be added in Digital Loker System Users: Government Office, Student, Industry, Institutes"

HOW THE PLATFORM WORKS:- 
The Institution or the Issuer signs up on our platform. 
The issuer needs to verify its identity. For this we take the real time picture of the authorised person and verify with his/her id. 
After that the issuer needs to upload the certificate template and the data of certificate holders (like name, class, secured position. etc.) 
Once the certificate is generated, it gets uploaded on the blockchain and secured using a hashcode. 
If someone wants to access his/her certificate, they need to enter the hashcode. 
The platform eventually helps identify false certificates.
